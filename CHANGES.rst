  the language independent folder link in translation menu as

  to connect, disconnect existing translations, as well as actions to create or delete a translation for you content item.
  [agitator]

- Moved stylesheet from legacy bundle to logged-in bundle
  [agitator]

Bug fixes:

- Made robot tests more robust, I hope.
  Before using 'Wait until element is visible',
  first call   'Wait until page contains element'.
  The first one only works reliably when the element was already on the page initially.
  If the element was created dynamically, you need to use the 'page contains' call first,
  otherwise you sometimes get an error:
  'Element not found in the cache - perhaps the page has changed since it was looked up.'
  [maurits]


4.0.4 (2016-09-16)
------------------

Bug fixes:

- Change RelatedItemsFieldWidget configuration from ``@@add_translations`` view to support Mockup 2.4.0, so that the widget is able to navigate beyond the INavigationRoot boundary and to access other translation trees.
  This change keeps compatibility with older versions of Mockup or Mockup-less setups.
