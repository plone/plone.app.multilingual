5.6.5 (2023-07-20)
------------------

Bug fixes:


- Fix ``set_recursive_language`` to actually find child objects.
  [maurits] (#304)
- Root language switcher: redirect to ``id-id`` if the Indonesian language is preferred.
  [maurits] (#304)
- Do not unset the language on the Indonesian root language folder when saving the control panel.
  This language has ``id`` as code.  This is not allowed as an id in Plone, so it is created as ``id-id`` instead.
  This needs some special handling.
  Added upgrade to recursively fix this language folder to set the Indonesian language.  This is only done when the folder itself has the wrong language.

  same order and with the same titles. The option to edit the current page in
  babel view have been merged with the options to edit the other translations
  to make the menu more consistent
  [datakurre]

- Translation menu show the title of the language independent folder on
  the language independent folder link in translation menu as
  "Open ${title} folder"

  was redundant (but less transparent in its behavior) to just cutting and
  pasting a content under the desired language folder

  to connect, disconnect existing translations, as well as actions to create or delete a translation for you content item.
  [agitator]

- Moved stylesheet from legacy bundle to logged-in bundle
  [agitator]

Bug fixes:

- Made robot tests more robust, I hope.
  Before using 'Wait until element is visible',
  first call   'Wait until page contains element'.
  The first one only works reliably when the element was already on the page initially.
  If the element was created dynamically, you need to use the 'page contains' call first,
  otherwise you sometimes get an error:
  'Element not found in the cache - perhaps the page has changed since it was looked up.'
  [maurits]


4.0.4 (2016-09-16)
------------------

Bug fixes:

- Change RelatedItemsFieldWidget configuration from ``@@add_translations`` view to support Mockup 2.4.0, so that the widget is able to navigate beyond the INavigationRoot boundary and to access other translation trees.
  This change keeps compatibility with older versions of Mockup or Mockup-less setups.
